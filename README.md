# Wu Wants to Be a Millionaire?

A playable <em>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</em>-style game using React.js, with all questions being about Wu-Tang Clan.

The game comes complete with authentic <em>Millionaire</em> sound effects at the start of a game and upon answering correctly or incorrectly, while selecting your answer triggers suspenseful music and a delayed reveal using CSS animation.

If a user wins the million, they are congratulated by the username they are prompted to enter at the beginning.

## Â Improvements I would like to make

It would be great to implement the '50-50', 'ask the audience' and 'phone a friend' lifelines so I may yet revisit this project if I find the time.
